    {"role": "user", "content": "Help me find the texts relevant to biological circuits design from the following chapters: the latch to be extensible, it must have two promoter inputs and two promoter outputs. If these are characterized with the same units, the information can be used to connect the latch to genetic sensors (Fig. 1A), other circuits, and cellular responses. Previously, we characterized insulatedNOR gates that have two input promoters in series driving the expression of a repressor that turns the output promoter off (55, 56). Because the promoters are arranged in series, their activity is summed, and the gate response function is treated as a single-input NOT gate (Fig. 1B). Our latch design uses this gate type, in which one of the NOR inputs is the set input promoter (S) to the latch and the other is a promoter regulated by a second NOR gate (Fig. 1C). In turn, the two inputs to the second NOR gate are the reset input promoter (R) to the latch and a promoter repressed by the first gate. The response function of aNOT gate captures how the gate’s output changes as a function of its input at steady state. Because the input and output promoter activities of the gates are measured in relative promoter units (RPUs) (seemethods), the two NOT functions can be plotted as nullclines on the same phase plane (Fig. 1D) (see the supplementary materials for the biophysical model) (54). The circuit is monostable when the nullclines only intersect once,meaning it does not exhibit the bistability necessary for a latch. When there are three intersections, the latch has two stable states separated by an unstable steady state. An exemplar is shown in Fig. 1C, where gates based on two repressors (AmtR and PhlF) are combined to design an SR latch. These gates use repressors that are Tet repressor (TetR) homologs and orthogonal; in other words, they do not bind to each other’s operators (34, 55). The ribosome binding site (RBS) that controls repressor expression can be used to change the threshold of a gate. Thus, by changing the RBS, the response function can be shifted in relation to the second gate in the latch until bistability is achieved (Fig. 1E) (57). A full bifurcation analysis was performed for the AmtR-PhlF SR latch from an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model (methods and supplementary files). This demarcates the boundaries of the SET, RESET, and HOLD regions within phase space (Fig. 1F). Note that there is also a FORBIDDEN region corresponding to the simultaneous activation of both inputs where the output signals degrade to an intermediate value. This bifurcation graph fully characterizes the SR latch and can be used to quantitatively predict the response obtained from connecting any two sensors, provided that their dynamic range is known in RPUs. Each sensor performs the SET and RESET functions and alternating their activity switches the latch repeatedly between the two stable states. Once in either state, the reduction of the input (e.g., input A when in the SET state) is not able to switch the latch state without turning on the other input. Thus, this acts as memory, where the state is held indefinitely (Fig. 1G) (58, 59). The AmtR-PhlF SR latch designwas constructed by using a two-plasmid system, one carrying the circuit and the other carrying an output promoter fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (fig. S1). The sensors that respond to anhydrotetracycline hydrochloride (aTc) (sensor A) and isopropylb- D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (sensor B) were used as inputs (Fig. 1A). Two output plasmids were constructed that independently report the Qa and Qb outputs (separate strains and experiments). Cells containing the circuit and one output plasmid were initialized by growing them to exponential phase in the absence of inducer and then diluting them into fresh media with either 2 ng/ml aTc or 1 mM IPTG (methods). Every 8 hours, the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry to measure YFP, and an aliquot was diluted into fresh media containing the same or different inducers. Figure 1H shows the response of the outputs of the circuit to changes in the activity of the sensors, shown as the square waveform. By alternating between inducers, the circuit can be switched back and forth repeatedly for 2 days and more than 60 generations without breaking.When one inducer is pulsed, the circuits hold their state over this period. Notably, the model quantitatively predicts the level of both outputs (dashed lines in Fig. 1H), including when the circuit is in an intermediate FORBIDDEN state and the steady state that is reached after the inducers are removed (fig. S4). A library of SR latches was then designed by combining gates based on 10 orthogonal repressors from the TetR repressor family that cooperatively bind their respective operator DNA sequence (34, 55). Each gate has a different response function that, when combined in a phase plane analysis, can be analyzed for bistability (Fig. 2A). Forming a bistable switch requires that nullclines intersect at three points. Of the 45 combinations, 23 are predicted to exhibit bistability (blue boxes in Fig. 2A); however, not all are expected to behave equally. In some cases, the distance between the stable and unstable steady states (d1 and d2 in Fig. 2B), referred to as the equilibria separation, is small (60). Another measure is transversality or, in other words, the degree to which the nullclines do not overlap. Switches with short equilibria separation and poor transversality are sensitive to fluctuations, which can drive the switch into the opposite state (fig. S5). As expected, cooperative gates with steeper thresholds are more likely to lead to bistable switches; for example, the PhlF gate (Hill coefficient n = 4.2) is predicted to form a bistable switch with all other repressors. The cooperativity of each repressor was measured empirically in the context of the gate. Cooperativity could arise from the formation of multimers and/or the binding to multiple sites in a promoter. We built the 15 SR latches that were predicted to be bistable, including some with short separation and poor transversality (Fig. 2C). These were constructed and evaluated, as described above (methods). Each latch was initialized in the first state (SET or RESET) by growing cells with the appropriate inducer. To test the latch’s memory, the cells were then grown in the absence of inducer (HOLD), and, after 8 hours, the outputs were assayed by flow cytometry. The measurements are compared to the predicted outputs in Fig. 2D. Eleven of the SR latches exhibited at least a 10-fold dynamic range and held both latch states. Four had one state that spontaneously flipped during the memory assay (red arrows in fig. S5), which could be predicted from the equilibrium separation (Fig. 2E). Intriguingly, the cutoff separation corresponds to the standard deviation of the cytometrypopulationwhen converted to RPU (fig. S2). For functional SR latches, the average dynamic range is 162-fold repression. An additional 26 SR latch circuits were constructed by permuting the sensors connected to the latches and RBS variants of the component gates. Because the sensors are measured in standardized units, in theory, it can easily be determined whether they can be functionally connected to a particular latch (Fig. 1F). For the AmtR-HlyIIR SR latch, six permutations of sensors were tested, and all were able to functionally connect as predicted (Fig. 2F). This was repeated for different permutations of sensors connected to latches comprised of different pairs of repressors (fig. S5). Out of this set of 26 SR latches, 19 latches were functional, and the measured outputs agreed with the predictions (fig. S6A). The latches that did not hold both states correlated with poor predicted equilibria separation (fig. S6B)."}
